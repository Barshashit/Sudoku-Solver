Sudoku solver mini projects on data structures and algorithms use the backtracking algorithm to resolve Sudoku puzzles. 
Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle game that requires you to fill in a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetitions allowed in the rows, columns, or 3x3 subgrids.

The first step in the Sudoku Solver project is to draw the puzzle as a 9x9 grid and fill it in with the specified numbers. 
The puzzle is then solved using the backtracking approach by iteratively trying out various values in each cell until a solution is discovered.

When the backtracking algorithm runs into a dead end, that is, when it comes into a contradiction that renders the problem impossible to solve, it will turn around and try another possible solution for each cell in the grid. 
Once a viable answer is found, the algorithm goes back and tests different values in the earlier cells.

The Sudoku Solver data structures and algorithms projects show how the backtracking algorithm can be used in real-world situations to solve challenging puzzles like Sudoku. It is beneficial for puzzle fans, game creators, and anybody else interested in logic-based problem-solving.
